7breaths
========

Calculate the respiratory rate of a patient easily and accurately

The initial idea was from Wai Keong on the NHS HackDay mailing list. Details of which are also on his blog http://wai2k.wordpress.com/2013/06/16/a-simple-app-for-counting-respiratory-rate/

7Breaths is an application to make measuring the respiratory rate clinically (i.e. by a person watching) easy.

The name "7Breaths" was suggested by Barry Rowlingson

The initial mailing list discussion can be found on the Google groups pages https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!topic/nhshackday/ioOECJ3ZVEI

## Building

The application has been built using the [Appcelerator Framework](http://www.appcelerator.com/developers/) and the Alloy compoment. Installation instructions and how to build appcelerator source is all on their website.
