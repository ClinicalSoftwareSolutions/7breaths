7breaths
========

Calculate the respiratory rate of a patient easily and accurately

The initial idea was from Wai Keong on the NHS HackDay mailing list. To quote:



7Breaths is an application to make measuring the respiratory rate clinically (i.e. by a person watching) easy.

The original idea was posted on the NHS HackDay mailing list and is on his blog

The name "7Breaths" was suggested by Barry Rowlingson

The initial mailing list discussion can be found on the Google groups pages [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!topic/nhshackday/ioOECJ3ZVEI]]
