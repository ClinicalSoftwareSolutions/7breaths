7breaths
========

Calculate the respiratory rate of a patient easily and accurately

The initial idea was from Wai Keong on the NHS HackDay mailing list. To quote:



7Breaths is an application to make measuring the respiratory rate clinically (i.e. by a person watching) easy.

The original idea was posted on the NHS HackDay mailing list and is on his blog

The name "7Breaths" was suggested by Barry Rowlingson
