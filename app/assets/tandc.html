<h2>General</h2>
<p>7Breaths is a mobile application designed to aid in clinically determining the respiratory rate of a
patient. The original idea was conceived by Wai Keong on the NHS HackDay mailing list and his blog.
Barry Rowlingson first suggested the application name.</p>

<p>We at <a href="http://www.clinsoftsolutions.com">Clinical Software Solutions</a> were excited by the idea and have implemented the application. The full source has been open sourced and is available in our GitHub repository at
